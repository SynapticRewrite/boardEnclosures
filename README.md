# Board Enclosure Files

Convienent dump spot for board enclosure files. Currently only contains files for a Tigard enclosure.


Tigard enclosure was made using 3mm acrylic on an 80 watt CO2 laser. SVG files are provided and should be able to be used with either a laser cutter or a mill. The 'clean' version should be usable right away, while the 'wip' version includes additional guide boxes and overlapping shapes for easy modification should fixes need to be made later.
